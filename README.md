This is a repository where I practice and hone my skills with the Reactjs framework.

## Countdown timer ‚è∞

The countdown timer is a mini project where I practice using hooks, setInterval, dayjs, and creating helper functions. It takes in the UNIX timestamp and counts down. 

This project was inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTWJypbcSLI&ab_channel=Olli

## Kanye's next big hit üé§

This mini project started out as a simple quote generator. However, I remembered being introduced to this Kanye West Rest API during my time in the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp and decided to make a quick Kanye West lyric generator where the app strings together 6 different quotes from the API to form a new verse for his next big hit! 

To add, I was able to practice making multiple GET requests at once and use Promise.All method to populate the state with data. 

*Need to add more styling later on*
